    <p>cookies are simple pastries that melt in your mouth. the most basic is sugar cookies but my personal favorite is the chocolate chip cookie.</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>all purpose flour</li>
      <li>unsalted butter</li>
      <li>granulated sugar</li>
      <li>brown sugar</li>
      <li>vanila extract</li>
      <li>baking soda</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Preheat and Prepare:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
      <li><strong>Cream Butter and Sugars:</strong>In a large bowl or stand mixer, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until the mixture is smooth, creamy, and light in color (about 2 to 4 minutes).</li>
      <li><strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong>Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract. Mix until fully combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Mix Wet and Dry:</strong>Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Mix on low speed until just combined—do not overmix.</li>
      <li><strong>Add Chocolate:</strong> Fold in the chocolate chips or chunks with a spatula.</li>
      <li><strong>Scoop Dough:</strong>Scoop 2–3 tablespoons of dough per cookie and place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches of space between them to allow for spreading.</li>
      <li><strong>Bake:</strong>Bake for 8–10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the center still looks slightly soft.</li>
      <li><strong>Cool:</strong>Let the cookies sit on the baking sheet for 5 minutes to settle, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
      <li></li>

    </ol>
